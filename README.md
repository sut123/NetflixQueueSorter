# NetflixQueueSorter

This is a short script to add a button that automatically sorts the Netflix DVD queue for you.

It currently sorts based on predicted reviews in descending order (most likely to enjoy goes to the top), shoves all of the titles available for streaming to the bottom of the queue so you don't waste a disc, and groups all series discs together.

Todo:
-------
0. Add UI to enable different types of sorts. (Different sorts are available in the code right now).
0. Enable GreaseMonkey usage.
